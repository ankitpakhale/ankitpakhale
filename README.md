I am a passionate data scientist and web developer, and I love to learn new things. I have a strong interest in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and other technologies that can make our lives easier. My passion for software lies in dreaming up ideas and making them come true with elegant interfaces. I take great care in the experience, architecture, and code quality of the things I build.
